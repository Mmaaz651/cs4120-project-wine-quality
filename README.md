## Dataset

The **White Wine Quality** dataset is automatically loaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

```python
pd.read_csv(
    "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv",
    sep=";"
)
```

### Alternate Method (Offline Use)

If you prefer to work offline or the UCI website is unavailable:

1. Download the dataset manually from:  
   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv

2. Place it inside the `data/` folder

3. Replace the above line in `src/data.py` with:

```python
pd.read_csv("data/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a virtual environment

It's recommended to isolate dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Install everything listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Verify installation

Run Python and ensure you can import all required libraries:

```python
import pandas, numpy, sklearn, mlflow
```

## How to Run the Project

### Run Baseline Models

To train models and log metrics:

```bash
python -m src.train_baselines
```

This will:

- Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree (for classification)
- Train Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor (for regression)
- Generate:
  - Confusion matrices (`*_confusion.png`)
  - Residuals vs Predicted plots (`*_residuals.png`)
  - Metric tables printed in the console
- Log all experiments using MLflow under `mlruns/`

### View MLflow Dashboard

Launch the experiment tracking UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then open your browser and go to:

 http://127.0.0.1:5000

Here you can visually compare all model runs, metrics, and artifacts.
